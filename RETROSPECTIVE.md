# Group XV Retrospective

## Code Smells
Our group has always struggled with keeping our code smell-free. \
In past iterations, we have done well on most of the rubric categories. \
However, we are usually penalized significantly for the smells that were introduced in our code. \
Below are a few causes and ways that this can be prevented. 

### Late Work
Firstly, our group has a bad habit of starting our work late. \
As a result of this, we submit our final contributions very close to the deadline. \
This leaves very little room for code reviews and thorough code checks. \
As a result, coding smells slip through. \
To prevent this from occurring in iteration 3, we should be starting early than usual. \
This will give us ample breathing room that can be used for reviewing code and hunting down smells. \
The success of this method is measured by how early our group begins working, and how much extra code review occurs as a result of this. \
7 days before the due date is an ideal starting time for our group. \
At least 3 peer code reviews is a suitable number. 

### Poor Attendance
Secondly, our group has had very poor attendance rate in class. \
On the first day of courses, 3 out of 5 group members were absent. \
The next month or two had great attendance rates, but this would not last. \
Average group attendance rate dwindled until only one group member was regularly attending class. \
By having group members attend class more consistently, perhaps the coding knowledge gained in lectures would reduce the probability of writing code smells.\
The success of this method is measured by the attendance rate of all group members. \
It should be considered a success if at least 3 group members attend per lecture. 

### Lack of Coordination
Thirdly, some simple code smells are caused by lack of coordination. \
Because our group has not discussed and agreed upon a universal coding standard, this causes simple formatting smells to occur. \
For example, in iteration 2, our group was not writing consistent comments and had left in a few lines of commented code. \
To alleviate this issue, it is strongly recommended that we agree upon one universal standard of code formatting and stick with it.\
If no more formatting smells occur because of this, then that is considered a success. \
There should be zero simple formatting smells in iteration 3. 

### Lack of Communication
Last but not least, our group members may not be communicating enough. \
In iteration 1, there was an inbalance of contribution quality and quantity among group members. \
This was primarily caused due to poor inter-group communication. 
The general expectation at the time was that group members would come forward and choose their own tasks to work on. \
However, the group would probably had succeeded to a higher degree if communications were more open. \
Smells may develop if group members are not communicating their ideas and sharing their code with others. \
It would be considered a success if all 5 group members began communicating at least 7 days before the deadline in iteration 3. 

## Project Velocity
[See project velocity here](projectVelocity.jpg) \
There is a clear trend that our group is underdelivering more and more for every iteration. \
This is compounded by the fact that we are postponing an increasing amount of issues to the next release. \
However, we are completing more issues for every iteration, thanks to the increasing number of smells.
