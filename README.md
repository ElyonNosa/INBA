# Vision Statement
INBA (INBA's Not a Banking App) is an app designed for those who spend money on a frequent basis, which analyzes spendings to advise towards a financially sustainable lifestyle by optimizing the saving/spending ratio.

## What is it?
This app serves as a primary platform for the user to record and view their day-to-day spendings. 
The app acts as an easy to use and visually appealing alternative to other reporting mediums. 
INBA also provides immersive visualizations, so the user can easily recognize vital information at a glance. 
Through the use of tracking, the app can notice and indicate trends in the user's purchasing habits. 
With the addition of cloud functionality, the user can log in from any device to record or view their spendings. 

## Who are the users?
The ideal demographic of this app includes those who spend money daily, perhaps on a wide variety of different services and products. 

This app will benefit those who record their spendings on a text file, spreadsheet or other file format. By switching to this app, their data will be easily viewable and parsable when compared to data on a basic file format. 

This app will help those who would like to be more conscious with their spending habits. These people will benefit from the alerts that will notify them if they are too free-handed with their spending. 

People who prefer visual information as opposed to simple text will make good use of informative visuals that the app provides. 

INBA aims to provide relevant information to the discerning spender in a visually appealing manner, so they may make informed decisions on where their money should be going. 

## Why is this project valuable?
The cost of living has risen by a significant amount, primarily due to rising inflation and increased demand from a restless population who is ready to move on from lockdown. 
Now is not a bad time to learn how to manage your spendings. 

Saving money is an important life skill that everyone should apply to their own spending habits. It also helps to have a safety net in the form of a money stockpile, in case things go wrong. This app will assist users on their journey to become an ideal money saver. 

In addition, the conventional apps used to track transactions may not be appealing to some, with their limited customizability and poor organization. Their appearance tends to be cluttered, showing irrelevant information upon opening the app. 

INBA will have a clean, minimalistic aesthetic, allowing users to easily find relevant info. This will be amplified by the ability to customize the appearance of the app. Ubiquity is the key goal of INBA. 

## What are the success criteria?
The project will be considered successful if the user can view their total monthly spendings and see where their money is going (their categories of spending) within 3 clicks or less.


Another criteria for success is that the user should be able to record their transactions within 2 clicks or less. 


It is ideal if INBA is preferred by 75% of users over their current financial planning platform.
