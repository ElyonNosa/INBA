## What is the purpose of this project?
- We wanted to create an app that allows users to record their transactions in their day-to-day life. 
- By viewing their spendings over the course of weeks and months, we hope that users will be more mindful of their transactions and may perhaps create good habits that will be followed for the rest of their lives. 
- The app uses various graphs and lists to show the user vital information at a glance. 
- We have implemented a modern aesthetic so the that app is more appealing compared to a simple spreadsheet or text file.
