# INBA -- Is Not a Banking App

## Vision Statement

INBA (INBA's Not a Banking App) is an app designed for those who spend money on a frequent basis, which analyzes spendings to advise towards a financially sustainable lifWestyle by optimizing the saving/spending ratio.

## What is it

This app serves as a primary platform for the user to record and view their day-to-day spendings.

The app acts as an easy to use and visually appealing alternative to other cash-flow reporting mediums.

## Who are the users

INBA is for those who spend money daily, perhaps on a wide variety of different services and products.

INBA aims to provide relevant information to the discerning spender in a visually appealing manner, so they may make informed decisions on where their money should be going.

## Why is this project valuable

The cost of living has risen by a significant amount, primarily due to rising inflation and increased demand from a restless population who is ready to move on from lockdown.

Now is not a bad time to learn how to manage your spendings.

Saving money is an important life skill that everyone should apply to their own spending habits. It also helps to have a safety net in the form of a money stockpile, in case things go wrong. This app will assist users on their journey to become an ideal money saver.

In addition, the conventional apps used to track transactions may not be appealing to some, with their limited customizability and poor organization. Their appearance tends to be cluttered, showing irrelevant information upon opening the app.

INBA will have a clean, minimalistic aesthetic, allowing users to easily find relevant info. This will be amplified by the ability to customize the appearance of the app. Ubiquity is the key goal of INBA.

## Overview of Major Functionality

Users have the ability to add and edit their transactions. When the transactions are added the graphical interfaces update to reflect any changes.

The dashboard displays the users contributions to the many different types of transactions and lists their most recent ones below.

The user can observe the transactions in many different graph variations! As well, they can add and update their transactions. Customize settings, and view their profile.

## What are the success criteria?

The project will be considered successful if the user can view their total monthly spendings and see where their money is going (their categories of spending) within 3 clicks or less.

Another criteria for success is that the user should be able to record their transactions within 2 clicks or less. 


It is ideal if INBA is preferred by 75% of users over their current financial planning platform. 

## How did the project change from your initial vision

The outcome of our vision did for the most part did come to fruition. We planned on creating an easy to use, visually appealing financial planning application. INBA is now a visually appealing and functions simply. This is an overall success from the vision that was planned months ago. We believe that INBA has the capacity to be a very useful application for all those.

## What went wrong or right?

Front-End development generally went smoothly, once the front-end team had an understanding of the mark-up that Android utilizes it was easy to create nice UIs. One challenge that happened in Front-End was changing application theme, online there are so many differing ways to do it and each implemented so differently. After choosing one, we had to refactor all the mark-up code to make it work. Eventually, a simple colour switcher was utilized, but there were many bugs, some that flickered the screen endlessly.

Another particularly challenging implementation was the switching of graphical displays. It due to changing the graphical implementations to successfully display the correct. Back-end development had some pitfalls. Databases that brick our computers and creating x many different versions of the database file to fix the issue.

## Features better than expected

Some features that turned out much better than anticipated was the graphical interfaces. It was challenging to implement, but it far overshot our expectations of what we thought we could complete. It looks better than the original designs and has more interaction than we intially planned.

The adding transaction feature is also past expectations. It is a so easy to use and allows all the functionality one could need. The querying by transaction type and date looks even better than designed and functions better than anticipated.
